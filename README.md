# atomicfish

Atomicfish is an interpreter of the deadfish esolang. It also has a REPL. 

To start the REPL, simply execute the atomicfish binary. To run it as an 
interpreter and run a file, pass it the name of the file as a single argument 
on the command line. In order for the interpreter to interpret and run a file 
the file must have a ".deadfish" file extension.
